## **Verse 1.1 — The Beginning of Creation**  

|                               |                                                        |
| ------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------ | 
| आत्मा वा इदमेकेवाग्रे आसीत् ।       |  Only Ātman existed.                                   |
| नान्यत्किञ्चन मिषत् ।               |  Nothing else stirred.                                 |
| स ईक्षत — लोकान्नु सृजा इति ॥      |  Ātman seemed to will: “Let me manifest the worlds.”   |

---

**आत्मा वा इदमेकेवाग्रे आसीत्** — *“In the beginning this was only the Self.”*  
Ātman – the Self │ vā – indeed │ idam – this (all that appears as the world) │ eka eva – alone, one without a second │ agre – at the beginning │ āsīt – was, existed  

> **Note:** “Beginning” (agre) implies no real time—only ontological priority. Ātman stands as the substrate before space-time conceptually arises.

**नान्यत्किञ्चन मिषत्** — *“Nothing else whatsoever moved or even winked.”*  
na – not │ anyat – anything other │ kiñcana – whatsoever │ miṣat – winked, stirred, functioned  

> **Note:** miṣat (“winked”) is poetic: it denies all motion or dual function. Reality is motionless awareness.  

**स ईक्षत — लोकान्नु सृजा इति** — *“He deliberated: ‘Let me create the worlds.’”*  
sa – He/That (Self) │ īkṣata – envisioned, deliberated │ lokān – worlds, fields of experience │ nu – indeed │ sṛjā – let me create │ iti – thus, so saying  

> **Note:** This “deliberation” is **adhyāropa**—a didactic superimposition of will on the changeless Brahman to explain the appearance of plurality.  

 
### **Reflection**

* “Before” and “creation” are **teaching metaphors**, not temporal events.  
* The Self’s “will” symbolizes **latent potential** in pure consciousness.  
* Treat the passage as a mirror for how **awareness itself appears to diversify** within our own cognition.

## **Verse 1.2 — The Creation of the Worlds**

|                                              |                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| स इमान् लोकान् असृजत—अम्भः मरीचीः मरम् आपः ।      | He created the worlds: **Ambhaḥ, Marīcīḥ, Mara, Āpaḥ**.               |
| अदः अम्भः, परेण दिवं, द्यौः प्रतिष्ठा ।                 | **Ambhaḥ** lies beyond, above heaven; **heaven (Dyauḥ)** is its base. |
| अन्तरिक्षं मरीचयः । पृथिवी मरः ।                     | **Marīcīḥ** is the mid-space; **Mara** is the Earth.                  |
| या अधस्तात् ताः आपः ।                            | What is below the Earth is **Āpaḥ** (waters, nether regions).         |

---

**स इमान् लोकान् असृजत—अम्भः मरीचीः मरम् आपः** — *“He created these worlds: Ambhaḥ, Marīcīḥ, Mara, Āpaḥ.”*
sa – He (the Self) │ imān – these │ lokān – worlds │ asṛjata – created │ ambhaḥ – Ambhaḥ (upper) │ marīcīḥ – Marīcīḥ (radiant mid-space) │ maraṃ – Mara (earth, the mortal) │ āpaḥ – Āpaḥ (waters, lower)

> **Note:** Fourfold set abbreviates the traditional **14 worlds**: Ambhaḥ ≈ the five upper heavens; Marīcīḥ ≈ the interspace; Mara ≈ Earth; Āpaḥ ≈ seven lower worlds.

**अदः अम्भः, परेण दिवं, द्यौः प्रतिष्ठा** — *“Ambhaḥ is beyond, above heaven; heaven (Dyauḥ) is its support.”*
adaḥ – that (far, beyond) │ ambhaḥ – Ambhaḥ │ pareṇa – beyond, further than │ divam – heaven │ dyauḥ – heaven/sky │ pratiṣṭhā – support/base

> **Note:** “Beyond” is **cosmological pedagogy**, not cartography; it signals a graded teaching ladder from subtler to grosser planes.

**अन्तरिक्षं मरीचयः । पृथिवी मरः** — *“Marīcīḥ is the mid-space; Mara is the Earth.”*
antarikṣam – mid-space │ marīcayaḥ – Marīcīḥ (radiant region) │ pṛthivī – Earth │ maraḥ – Mara (the mortal realm)

> **Note:** “Mara” shares the root *mṛ* (to die), marking Earth as the **plane of mortality**.

**या अधस्तात् ताः आपः** — *“Those below are Āpaḥ (waters).”*
yā – which (regions) │ adhastāt – below │ tāḥ – those │ āpaḥ – waters (symbol for the **lower strata/nether worlds**)

> **Note:** “Waters” symbolize **undifferentiated substrate** and also code the nether regions; this is mnemonic, not hydrography.

### **Reflection**

* The fourfold schema is a **pedagogic compression** of 14 loci; do not literalize the map.
* “Beyond” and “below” mark **subtle-to-gross hierarchy**, not GPS coordinates.
* Earth as **Mara** centers ethical urgency: mortality makes inquiry actionable **now**.

## **Verse 1.3 — The Creation of the First Deity (Hiraṇyagarbha)**

|                                           |                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| स ईक्षत—इमे नु लोकाः ।                        | He deliberated: “Here now are the worlds.”                 |
| लोकपालान्नु सृजा इति ।                         | “Let Me create the guardians of these worlds.”             |
| स आद्भ्यः पुरुषं संउद्धृत्य अमूर्च्छयत् ।             | Then, taking up from the waters a Person, He gave it form. |

**स ईक्षत—इमे नु लोकाः** — *“He reflected: ‘Here now are the worlds.’”*
sa – He (the Self) │ īkṣata – envisioned, reflected │ ime – these │ nu – indeed, now │ lokāḥ – worlds

> **Note:** This reflection signals transition from inert potential to conscious organization. “He saw” means **awareness recognized its own manifestation**.

**लोकपालान्नु सृजा इति** — *“Let Me create the protectors of these worlds.”*
lokapālān – guardians, rulers │ nu – indeed │ sṛjā – let me create │ iti – thus, so said

> **Note:** “Protectors” (Devatās) personify **laws or governing principles**. In Vedāntic logic, every sensory or cosmic function requires a corresponding *intelligence-field* (Devatā).

**स आद्भ्यः पुरुषं संउद्धृत्य अमूर्च्छयत्** — *“From the waters He lifted a Person and gave it form.”*
sa – He │ ādbhyaḥ – from the waters (primordial causal matrix) │ puruṣam – a Person, archetypal being │ samuddhṛtya – having taken out, drawn forth │ amūrcchayat – shaped, gave solid or distinct form

> **Note:**
>
> * “Waters” (Āpaḥ) again denote **causal potentiality**, not literal fluid.
> * “Person” (Puruṣa) here is **Hiraṇyagarbha**—the first embodied consciousness, the seed of all subtle life.
> * Creation via “lifting from water” mirrors **mind arising from undifferentiated consciousness**.

### **Reflection**

* “Deities” are metaphors for **governing intelligences**—the laws of perception and nature.
* “Water” symbolizes **potential consciousness**; “Person” symbolizes **reflected consciousness** (the subtle Self).
* The act of shaping (*amūrcchayat*) portrays how awareness **takes form without losing its formless essence**.

## **Verse 1.4 — The Eight Chief Devatās Are Created**

|                                                                 |                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| तमभ्यतपत् । तस्याभितप्तस्य मुखं निरभिद्यत यथा अण्डं ।           | He brooded upon that (Puruṣa); and from that brooding, a mouth burst forth—just as an egg cracks. |
| मुखात् वाक् । वाचः अग्निः ।                                     | From the mouth came Speech; from speech, Fire (Agni).                                             |
| नासिके निरभिद्येताम् । नासिकाभ्याम् प्राणः । प्राणात् वायुः ।   | The nostrils opened; from them came Breath, and from breath, Air (Vāyu).                          |
| अक्षिणी निरभिद्येताम् । अक्षिभ्याम् चक्षुः । चक्षुषः आदित्यः ।  | The eyes burst forth; from them came sight, and from sight, the Sun (Āditya).                     |
| कर्णौ निरभिद्येताम् । कर्णाभ्याम् श्रोत्रम् । श्रोत्रात् दिशः । | The ears opened; from them came hearing, and from hearing, the Quarters (Diśaḥ — Space).          |
| त्वक् निरभिद्यत । त्वचः लोमानि । लोमभ्यः औषधिवनस्पतयः ।         | The skin appeared; from skin came hair, from hair, the herbs and trees (plant life).              |
| हृदयं निरभिद्यत । हृदयात् मनः । मनसः चन्द्रमाः ।                | The heart opened; from the heart came mind, and from mind, the Moon (Candrama).                   |
| नाभिः निरभिद्यत । नाभ्याः अपानः । अपानात् मृत्युः ।             | The navel opened; from the navel came the Apāna (downward breath); from Apāna, Death (Mṛtyu).     |
| शिश्नं निरभिद्यत । शिश्नात् रेतः । रेतसः आपः ।                  | The generative organ opened; from it came seed; from seed, Waters (Āpaḥ).                         |

**तमभ्यतपत् । तस्याभितप्तस्य मुखं निरभिद्यत यथा अण्डं** — *“He brooded upon that; and as He brooded, the mouth burst forth, as an egg cracks.”*
tam – that (Puruṣa) │ abhyatapat – He brooded upon, heated by tapas │ tasya – of him │ abhitaptasya – when thus brooded/heated │ mukhaṃ – mouth │ nirabhidyata – split open, burst forth │ yathā – as │ aṇḍam – an egg

> **Note:** “Brooding” (*tapas*) symbolizes **the concentration of awareness into creative potential**. “Egg” evokes latent life emerging from unity.

**मुखात् वाक् । वाचः अग्निः** — *“From the mouth, speech; from speech, fire.”*
mukhāt – from the mouth │ vāk – speech │ vācaḥ – from speech │ agniḥ – fire

> **Note:** Speech and fire both express **energy and transformation**—the power of manifestation through sound and heat.

**नासिके निरभिद्येताम् । नासिकाभ्याम् प्राणः । प्राणात् वायुः** — *“The nostrils opened; from them breath; from breath, air.”*
nāsike – nostrils │ nirabhidyetām – were opened │ nāsikābhyām – from the nostrils │ prāṇaḥ – breath │ prāṇāt – from breath │ vāyuḥ – air

> **Note:** Air corresponds to **vital motion**, connecting macrocosmic wind and microcosmic respiration.

**अक्षिणी निरभिद्येताम् । अक्षिभ्याम् चक्षुः । चक्षुषः आदित्यः** — *“The eyes opened; from them sight; from sight, the Sun.”*
akṣiṇī – eyes │ nirabhidyetām – were opened │ akṣibhyām – from the eyes │ cakṣuḥ – sight │ cakṣuṣaḥ – from sight │ ādityaḥ – the Sun

> **Note:** The Sun is the cosmic counterpart of sight; **light enables perception both externally and internally.**

**कर्णौ निरभिद्येताम् । कर्णाभ्याम् श्रोत्रम् । श्रोत्रात् दिशः** — *“The ears opened; from them hearing; from hearing, space (the quarters).”*
karṇau – ears │ nirabhidyetām – were opened │ karṇābhyām – from the ears │ śrotram – hearing │ śrotrāt – from hearing │ diśaḥ – directions, space

> **Note:** Hearing requires space to transmit vibration; hence **sound and space** are linked.

**त्वक् निरभिद्यत । त्वचः लोमानि । लोमभ्यः औषधिवनस्पतयः** — *“The skin opened; from skin hair; from hair, herbs and trees.”*
tvak – skin │ nirabhidyata – opened │ tvacaḥ – from skin │ lomāni – hairs │ lomabhyaḥ – from hair │ auṣadhi-vanaspatayaḥ – herbs and trees

> **Note:** The body’s surface mirrors the Earth’s vegetation; **microcosm mirrors macrocosm.**

**हृदयं निरभिद्यत । हृदयात् मनः । मनसः चन्द्रमाः** — *“The heart opened; from the heart, mind; from mind, the Moon.”*
hṛdayam – heart │ nirabhidyata – opened │ hṛdayāt – from heart │ manaḥ – mind │ manasaḥ – from mind │ candramāḥ – Moon

> **Note:** The Moon’s changing phases symbolize **fluctuating thought and emotion**.

**नाभिः निरभिद्यत । नाभ्याः अपानः । अपानात् मृत्युः** — *“The navel opened; from navel, the Apāna (downward breath); from Apāna, Death.”*
nābhiḥ – navel │ nirabhidyata – opened │ nābhyāḥ – from navel │ apānaḥ – downward breath │ apānāt – from apāna │ mṛtyuḥ – death

> **Note:** Apāna governs elimination and decay—its Deity is **Mṛtyu**, lord of return to elements.

**शिश्नं निरभिद्यत । शिश्नात् रेतः । रेतसः आपः** — *“The generative organ opened; from it seed; from seed, waters.”*
śiśnam – generative organ │ nirabhidyata – opened │ śiśnāt – from organ │ retaḥ – seed │ retasaḥ – from seed │ āpaḥ – waters

> **Note:** The creative cycle closes with **Waters**, returning to the primal matrix from which life first emerged.

### **Reflection**

* This verse describes a **symbolic embryology of the cosmos**—organs, their functions, and corresponding Devatās mirror the laws of perception.
* Each pair “organ–function–Deity” affirms the **unity between microcosm and macrocosm**.
* “Bursting forth” depicts **conscious differentiation**, not physical explosion.
* The sequence is poetic pedagogy: awareness becomes sense, sense becomes world.
