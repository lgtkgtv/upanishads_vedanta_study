# **Part 2 — “The Three Births” (Chapter 4)**

* **Shifts the focus from *cosmic creation* to *individual embodiment*.**
* **It traces how consciousness expresses itself as life, lineage, and realization.**

We have experienced a sudden turn in our emotion at the end of the last chapter. With Creation as our theme, we rose to the heights of the Joy of realization, only to be suddenly plunged into the sad awareness of our bondage due to forgetfulness of God.
In this chapter a similar transition from joy to sorrow is attempted by the imaginative Rishi, but with a significant difference: This time we are raised to the heights of the joys of family life, only to be suddenly plunged down into an awareness of the senselessness and endlessness of the monotony of worldly existence

BIRTH becomes the theme that carries us to the climax of emotion in family life, What does this climax end in? – the futility of going through the cycle of “births” again and again. 
With great delicacy, the Rishi takes us on a journey of recounting three births, not just one. By doing so, he graphically multiplies threefold our agony of going through birth after birth after birth!
The Rishi, with a sense of being dutybound to take us forward, does not permit us to stagnate in comfort. He works our emotions in such a way as to awaken in us a desire to be liberated from Samsara once and for all.  That is, after all, why we call him a Rishi.

The chapter begins on the theme of love and union as encountered within the family unit, the domestic framework of life. There is a build-up of tenderness and love emerging through the theme. It touches on the most intimate aspects of human life. 
To most people, this is what their life centres on. For now we enter the raptures of the Grihastha world, the cradle of humanity, with its joys of having a child and rearing it in love .

## **Verse 4.1 — The First Birth – The Pregnant Father**

|                                        |                                                                |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| स एव एषः एतस्मिन् पुरुषे गर्भं दधाति ।         | That very Self places the seed (germ of life) within the male. |
| तद् एतदस्य प्रथमं जन्म ।                    | This is his first birth.                                       |

---

**स एव एषः एतस्मिन् पुरुषे गर्भं दधाति।** — *“That very Self places the germ within the male.”*  
sa eva eṣaḥ – that same (Self who entered creation) │ etasmin puruṣe – in this man │ garbhaṃ dadhāti – places, deposits the embryo/seed

> **Note:** Creation now operates at the microcosmic level: the *Ātman* who “entered” the cosmos becomes the **seed of individuality** in each person. “Placing the germ” is not mechanical fertilization—it means the infusion of **consciousness into potential life**.

---

**तद् एतदस्य प्रथमं जन्म।** — *“This is his first birth.”*  
tad etat – that indeed │ asya – his │ prathamaṃ – first │ janma – birth

> **Note:** The first “birth” occurs when life arises in the father as **intentional continuation**—the will to create. The living seed (*retas*) carries consciousness from one body to the next; thus, the father becomes the **first container of rebirth**.

---

### **Interpretive Notes**

* The Upanishad interprets procreation as **a sacred transmission of consciousness**, not merely biology.
* The “father” symbolizes **cause**, the “seed” the **essence of life that never dies**.
* This verse subtly connects with 3.12 – 3.14: the same Self that “entered” the universe now enters the individual through lineage.

---

### **Reflection**

* Every generation is a continuation of the same **Ātman-flow** through bodies.
* To see parenthood as sacred means recognizing that **life’s continuity is divine work**, not personal ownership.
* Spiritually, this “first birth” is symbolic of **conscious potential**—the spark of the infinite lodging itself within form.

---

## **Verse 4.2 — The Development of the Foetus**

|                                                     |                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| तं स्त्री गर्भे दधाति ।                                     | The woman receives him into herself as the embryo.                |
| स तस्याः तत्र पितुः एव आत्मा भवति ।                       | There, within her, he becomes the very self of the father.        |
| स एतस्याः स्त्रियाः न प्रमुच्यते, स एतस्याः एव स्त्रियाः न प्रमुच्यते।   | He does not become separate from her; he remains as one with her. |

---

**तं स्त्री गर्भे दधाति।** — *“The woman receives him into herself as the embryo.”*  
taṃ – him (the seed or consciousness placed by the Self) │ strī – the woman │ garbhe – in the womb │ dadhāti – places, conceives

> **Note:** The second stage begins. The feminine principle (*śakti*) now becomes the **nurturing field** where consciousness takes bodily form. Conception is the continuation of divine descent into matter.

---

**स तस्याः तत्र पितुः एव आत्मा भवति।** — *“There, within her, he becomes the very Self of the father.”*  
saḥ – he (the conceived being) │ tasyāḥ – of that woman │ tatra – there (in the womb) │ pituḥ – of the father │ eva – indeed │ ātmā – the self │ bhavati – becomes

> **Note:** The embryo is not merely the father’s physical progeny but **his own self reborn**. The Upanishad implies **continuity of consciousness through lineage**, where the father’s living essence extends into the next form.

---

**स एतस्याः स्त्रियाः न प्रमुच्यते, स एतस्याः एव स्त्रियाः न प्रमुच्यते।** — *“He does not become separate from her; he remains one with her.”*  
saḥ – he │ etasyāḥ – of this woman │ striyāḥ – woman │ na – not │ pramucyate – is released, separated

> **Note:** This repetition poetically stresses **interdependence**: at this stage, life is indistinguishable from the mother’s body and nourishment. The father’s essence, now enclosed in the mother, is still bound to her until birth.

---

### **Interpretive Notes**

* The Upanishad continues its theme of **unity-in-duality**: father and mother represent the creative dyad of consciousness (*puruṣa*) and energy (*prakṛti*).
* The “Self of the father” becoming the embryo symbolizes **continuity without separation**—life as a flowing process, not isolated events.
* The unborn being embodies the **same Ātman**, now sheathed in developing matter (*annamaya kośa*).

---

### **Reflection**

* Biological processes are here transfigured into **spiritual metaphors** for the persistence of consciousness.
* The verse honors motherhood as **manifestation’s temple**—the place where the divine Self takes visible form.
* Spiritually, it reminds the seeker that creation and sustenance are **one continuous act of Self-expression**—there is no break between creator, carrier, and created.

## **Verse 4.3 — The Second Birth – The Pregnant Mother**

|                                                  |                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| सा एनं जातं बिभर्ति ।                                 | She bears him after he is born.                       |
| स एष पुनः एव जायते ।                               | Thus he is born again — a second time.                |
| स एतस्याः एव स्त्रियाः आत्मा भवति ।                      | He becomes the very self of that woman.               |
| यथा एषां एष एवम् तस्मात् एताः पितृ-मतः गच्छन्ति।           | Therefore, women rightfully belong to their husbands. |

---

**सा एनं जातं बिभर्ति।** — *“She bears him after he is born.”*  
sā – she (the mother) │ enam – him (the child) │ jātam – born │ bibharti – nourishes, sustains, carries

> **Note:** After delivery, the mother continues to sustain the child. “Bearing” extends beyond gestation—it means the **protection and nourishment** of new life.

---

**स एष पुनः एव जायते।** — *“Thus he is born again — a second time.”*  
saḥ – he │ eṣaḥ – this (same being) │ punaḥ – again │ eva – indeed │ jāyate – is born

> **Note:** This is the **second birth**, from the mother’s womb into the external world. The same consciousness (*Ātman*) that dwelt within the father’s seed now manifests outwardly through the mother’s body.

---

**स एतस्याः एव स्त्रियाः आत्मा भवति।** — *“He becomes the very self of that woman.”*  
saḥ – he │ etasyāḥ – of that │ striyāḥ – woman │ eva – indeed │ ātmā – self │ bhavati – becomes

> **Note:** The child and mother remain **one life**, bound by the same breath and emotion. The verse underscores the **non-separation of beings**—what appears as two is one continuum of Self.

---

**यथा एषां एष एवम् तस्मात् एताः पितृ-मतः गच्छन्ति।** — *“Therefore, women rightfully belong to their husbands.”*  
yathā – as │ eṣām – of these (men) │ eṣaḥ – this (child) │ evam – thus (belonging, continuation) │ tasmāt – therefore │ etāḥ – these (women) │ pitṛmataḥ – belonging to the fathers/husbands │ gacchanti – go, are said to be

> **Note (critical):**
> This line reflects the **social idiom of Vedic society**, not metaphysical hierarchy. “Belonging” here indicates **continuity of lineage**, not possession. It means *“through the woman, the father’s self continues.”*
> Interpreted ethically, it teaches **mutual participation** in sustaining life, not subservience.

---

### **Interpretive Notes**

* The “second birth” (through the mother) completes the first cycle of **biological manifestation**.
* The same Ātman now experiences existence through body, senses, and relation.
* The verse’s closing social note should be read contextually—as ancient recognition of **family continuity**, not gender dominance.

---

### **Reflection**

* The “two births” (from father, then mother) reveal how the **one Self takes successive coverings**—first as seed (potential), then as body (actual).
* Ethically, it calls for **gratitude toward parents** as visible channels of divine continuity.
* Spiritually, it reminds that embodiment is sacred participation in creation—**the world mothering the Divine into visibility**.

## **Verse 4.4 — The Third Birth – The Pregnant Son**

|                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| स एष पुनः एव पुत्रे जायते ।                                                             | He is born again as the son.                                                                                                     |
| एष तस्य तृतीयं जन्म ।                                                                 | This is his third birth.                                                                                                         |
| स यं एष एवम् विद्वान् ब्राह्मणः त्रेण आत्मना अनुशृणोति, तेन एष ब्रह्मणा त्रयाणां जन्मनाम् आत्मना अनुशृणोति।  | When a wise Brāhmaṇa realizes this truth through knowledge of the Self, he transcends these three births through that very Self. |

---

**स एष पुनः एव पुत्रे जायते।** — *“He is born again as the son.”*  
saḥ – he │ eṣaḥ – this same being │ punaḥ – again │ eva – indeed │ putre – in the son │ jāyate – is born

> **Note:** The continuity of life is described as the **father reborn through the son**—not as egoic ownership, but as transmission of consciousness. The same *Ātman* that animated the father and was nurtured by the mother reappears in the offspring. Thus, life is a **single unbroken flow**.

---

**एष तस्य तृतीयं जन्म।** — *“This is his third birth.”*  
eṣaḥ – this │ tasya – his │ tṛtīyaṃ – third │ janma – birth

> **Note:** The three births now stand complete:
>
> 1. **In the father** (seed as intention of creation),
> 2. **In the mother** (gestation and external birth),
> 3. **In the son** (continuity of consciousness).
>    These are the **three visible births of the same Self** in the embodied cycle.

---

**स यं एष एवम् विद्वान् ब्राह्मणः त्रेण आत्मना अनुशृणोति, तेन एष ब्रह्मणा त्रयाणां जन्मनाम् आत्मना अनुशृणोति।** — *“When a wise Brāhmaṇa realizes this through knowledge of the Self, he transcends these three births through that very Self.”*  
saḥ – he │ yam – which (truth) │ eṣaḥ – this │ evam – thus │ vidvān – the wise one │ brāhmaṇaḥ – seeker of Brahman │ trēṇa – three │ ātmana – by the Self │ anuśṛṇoti – hears, understands, transcends │ tena – by that │ eṣaḥ – this (one) │ brahmaṇā – through Brahman │ trayāṇām janmanām – of the three births │ ātmana – by the Self │ anuśṛṇoti – goes beyond, follows through

> **Note:** *Anuśṛṇoti* (“follows or transcends”) implies that the knower perceives **these three births as appearances within one unbroken Self**. The “Brāhmaṇa” here is not by caste but by realization—the one who sees **Brahman everywhere**.

---

### **Interpretive Notes**

* The verse unites **genealogical, psychological, and spiritual** readings: life perpetuates, yet the Self is unborn and undying.
* By understanding the unity behind all births, one becomes *“twice-born”* in the higher sense—the **rebirth of consciousness into itself**.
* Thus, the Upanishad bridges biological lineage and spiritual liberation: both are movements of one awareness.

---

### **Reflection**

* The “three births” are allegories of **manifestation, sustenance, and transcendence**.
* True freedom lies not in the endless cycle of reproduction but in **recognizing the eternal witness** that never actually takes birth.
* Ethically, it invites reverence for life’s continuity, yet detachment from identification with body or lineage.
* Spiritually, this verse marks the Upanishad’s **pivot from creation to realization**—the seeker now turns inward to discover the Self beyond all births and deaths.

## **Verse 4.5 — Breaking Through Iron Fetters**

|                                                                       |                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| तद् एतत् पुत्रत्वम् एव पितृत्वम्, इति।                                           | Thus, the sonhood itself is fatherhood.                                                             |
| स य एषः एवम् विद्वान् ब्राह्मणः त्रेण आत्मना अनुशृणोति, स एष पाशान् हिरण्ययान् भिनत्ति।    | The wise Brāhmaṇa who knows this truth through the Self breaks through these golden (iron) fetters. |
| स एष एषां पाप्मानं सर्वं अन्तरात्मना संहरति, स एष एषां सर्वं आत्मना संहरति।             | He gathers and dissolves within himself all evil, all limitation, through the inner Self.           |

---

**तद् एतत् पुत्रत्वम् एव पितृत्वम्, इति।** — *“Thus, the sonhood itself is fatherhood.”*  
tat etat – thus, this │ putratvam – sonhood │ eva – itself │ pitṛtvam – fatherhood │ iti – so it is said

> **Note:** This concise statement collapses the apparent duality of father and son. The *Ātman* that appears as the father reappears as the son—**no real separation exists**. Creation is circular, not linear; the creator becomes the created.

---

**स य एषः एवम् विद्वान् ब्राह्मणः त्रेण आत्मना अनुशृणोति, स एष पाशान् हिरण्ययान् भिनत्ति।** — *“The wise Brāhmaṇa who understands this truth through the Self breaks through these golden fetters.”*  
saḥ – he │ yaḥ – who │ eṣaḥ – this │ evam – thus │ vidvān – knower │ brāhmaṇaḥ – wise person (knower of Brahman) │ trēṇa ātmana – by the threefold Self (through the three births) │ anuśṛṇoti – realizes, follows through │ saḥ eṣaḥ – that one │ pāśān – fetters, bonds │ hiraṇyayān – golden or iron (precious yet binding) │ bhinatti – breaks, shatters

> **Note:** The *“golden fetters”* (hiraṇmayāḥ pāśāḥ) symbolize the **attachments of pleasure, lineage, and pride in creation**—beautiful but binding. Knowledge (*vidyā*) breaks even subtle bondage that masquerades as virtue or prosperity.

---

**स एष एषां पाप्मानं सर्वं अन्तरात्मना संहरति, स एष एषां सर्वं आत्मना संहरति।** — *“He gathers and dissolves within himself all evil, all limitation, through the inner Self.”*  
saḥ – he │ eṣaḥ – this realized one │ eṣām – of them (beings, actions) │ pāpmānam – evil, sin, imperfection │ sarvam – all │ antarātmanā – by the inner Self │ saṃharati – gathers in, dissolves │ saḥ eṣaḥ – he indeed │ eṣām sarvam – all (their) existence │ ātmanā – by the Self │ saṃharati – absorbs, transcends

> **Note:** Realization absorbs all opposites. Evil and good, bondage and liberation—all dissolve into the **inner Self (antarātman)**, the luminous witness untouched by action. The “breaking of fetters” is not destruction but **assimilation through awareness**.

---

### **Interpretive Notes**

* *Putratvam eva pitṛtvam* — the circle of creation implies **no beginning or end**; hence, in realization, rebirth ceases.
* The *Brāhmaṇa* here represents **any knower of the Self**, who transcends biological and karmic continuities.
* *Pāśa* (fetter) means dependence on form and identity; *bhinatti* (breaks) is the awakening of freedom (*mokṣa*).

---

### **Reflection**

* This verse declares the **liberation of the enlightened one**—bondage dissolves through self-knowledge.
* The “golden fetters” warn against even subtle pride in virtue, family, or ritual merit.
* Ethically, it inspires inner renunciation amid outer action.
* Spiritually, it confirms that when consciousness recognizes itself as the source and substance of all births, **nothing external can bind it again.**

## **Verse 4.6 — The Liberation of Vāmadeva: Jīvanmukti and Videhamukti**

|                                                  |                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| स एष एषः वै देवानां पितरः।                            | He, indeed, is the father of the gods.                                                           |
| यद् एषः एवम् विद्वान् ब्राह्मणः पाप्मनः विमुक्तः।               | That wise Brāhmaṇa, having known thus, is freed from sin and bondage.                            |
| स एष वामदेवः एवम् विद्वान् प्राह— “अहम् मनुरभवम् सूर्यश्च।”    | Such a seer was Vāmadeva, who, having realized this, declared: “I have become Manu and the Sun!” |
| तथा एषः अपि एवम् विद्वान् एषः एवम् प्रजायते।              | Likewise, whoever realizes thus, he too becomes that (Infinite Self).                            |

---

**स एष एषः वै देवानां पितरः।** — *“He, indeed, is the father of the gods.”*  
saḥ eṣaḥ eṣaḥ – that very one │ vai – indeed │ devānām – of the gods │ pitaraḥ – father

> **Note:** The realized being is the **source of all faculties and deities**, for the gods (Devatās) are his own functions. Awareness becomes the progenitor of all powers once it recognizes itself as their ground.

---

**यद् एषः एवम् विद्वान् ब्राह्मणः पाप्मनः विमुक्तः।** — *“That wise Brāhmaṇa, having known thus, is freed from all evil.”*  
yat – when │ eṣaḥ – this │ evam – thus │ vidvān – knower │ brāhmaṇaḥ – seeker of Brahman │ pāpmanah – from sin or limitation │ vimuktaḥ – freed

> **Note:** Sin (*pāpmā*) here means **ignorance and identification with the finite**. Liberation arises not from ritual purity but from **knowledge of the Self as Brahman**.

---

**स एष वामदेवः एवम् विद्वान् प्राह— “अहम् मनुरभवम् सूर्यश्च।”** — *“Such a seer was Vāmadeva, who, having realized this, said: ‘I have become Manu and the Sun!’”*  
saḥ eṣaḥ – that very one │ vāmadevaḥ – the sage Vāmadeva │ evam – thus │ vidvān – knowing │ prāha – said │ aham – I │ manuḥ abhavam – have become Manu (the archetypal human) │ sūryaś ca – and the Sun

> **Note:** Vāmadeva, while still in the womb (as told in legend), attained realization and declared **identity with all beings**. “I am Manu and the Sun” means: *I am the essence of humanity and the source of light*—the universal Self experienced in all forms.

---

**तथा एषः अपि एवम् विद्वान् एषः एवम् प्रजायते।** — *“Likewise, whoever realizes thus, he too becomes that (Infinite Self).”*  
tathā – likewise │ eṣaḥ – this (seeker) │ api – also │ evam – thus │ vidvān – knowing │ eṣaḥ – he │ evam – thus │ prajāyate – becomes, is born as (that same reality)

> **Note:** The final statement universalizes Vāmadeva’s realization—**anyone** who knows the Self becomes *that very Brahman*, transcending individuality and rebirth. This is *jīvanmukti* (freedom while living) and *videhamukti* (freedom beyond the body).

---

### **Interpretive Notes**

* The **three births** culminate here: the one who understands them dissolves their cycle entirely.
* Vāmadeva stands as archetype of **innate realization**—the awakened awareness that proclaims unity from within limitation.
* “Father of the gods” signals complete integration: the liberated one is no longer ruled by senses or elements but is their master.

---

### **Reflection**

* Liberation (*mokṣa*) is not an event after death but a **recognition while alive** that “I am the Self of all.”
* The sage’s declaration “I am Manu and the Sun” embodies **universal identity**, not egoic expansion.
* Ethically, this realization inspires **non-separation and compassion**—seeing the same Self in all.
* Spiritually, the chapter closes the human cycle: from seed to awareness, from ignorance to radiance, culminating in **Self as All**.
